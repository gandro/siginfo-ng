siginfo-ng - Next Generation Siginfo Client
===========================================

Build:

    $ make
    $ make install

Requirements:

    - POSIX.1-2001 compatible operating system
    - C-Compiler (with C99 snprintf and vsnprintf, as well as GNU getopt_long)
    - Lua Programming Language libraries

    Plugins may have additional requirements.

    Note:

        If you don't have or don't want Lua on your system, you may use the
        following command to compile and link it statically into the siginfo-ng
        binary:

            $ make include-lua

        If your libc does not support getopt_long, you may remove the
        OPTIONS=-DUSE_GETOPT_LONG macro in the Makefile.

Usage:

    siginfo-ng [--show | --daemon | --help | --version]
               [--config=CONFIGFILE] [--log=LOGFILE]

    Available Options:

        -s, --show          Show Siginfo layout and quit
        -d, --daemon        Run as daemon

        -c, --config=FILE   Load settings from file
        -l, --logfile=FILE  Write error messages to logfile

        -h, --help          Show this help and quit
        -V, --version       Show version number an quit
