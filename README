siginfo-ng - Next Generation Siginfo Client
===========================================

Build:

    $ make config
    $ make
    $ make install

Make sure you have 'make' and a C compiler installed. Also do not select 
plugins which do not match to your system, otherwise it may won't compile.
If the compilation fails, you may want to run "make clean" before recompiling.
